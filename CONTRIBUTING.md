# Issue Management

This repository actively manages issues to attempt to keep the set of open issues small enough to be easily managed, searchable and have clear timeline expectations. Here are the policies around issues:

- Issues tagged as "Need more data" need more information from the opener to be acted on. If the information isn't provided within 7 days the issue will be closed. Will reopen if the data is provided at a later date.
- Issues in the [Unscheduled Milestone](https://github.com/jaredpar/VsVim/milestone/11) are valid problems but one the maintainer doesn't expect to fix themselves.
